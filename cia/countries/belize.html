    <h3>
        Background
    </h3>
    <p>
        Belize was the site of several Mayan city states until their decline at the end of the first millennium A.D. The
        British and Spanish
        disputed the region in the 17th and 18th centuries; it formally became the colony of British Honduras in 1862.
        Territorial disputes between
        the UK and Guatemala delayed the independence of Belize until 1981. Guatemala refused to recognize the new
        nation until 1992, and the two countries
        are still involved in an ongoing border dispute. Tourism has become the mainstay of the economy. Current
        concerns include the country's heavy foreign debt
        burden, high crime rates, high unemployment combined with a majority youth population,
        growing involvement in the Mexican and South American drug trade, and one of the highest HIV/AIDS prevalence
        rates in Central America.
