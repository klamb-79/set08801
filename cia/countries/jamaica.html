    <h3>
        Background
    </h3>
    <p>
        The Arawak and Taino peoples were the first inhabitants of Jamaica. Christopher COLUMBUS claimed the island
        for Spain in 1494, leading to the decline of the native population due to disease and enslavement. The British
        took control of Jamaica in 1655, and it became a major center for sugar production using enslaved African labor.
        Jamaica gained independence from the United Kingdom in 1962 and has since developed a vibrant culture known for
        its music, cuisine, and contributions to sports.
