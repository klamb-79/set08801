    <h3>
        Background
    </h3>
    <p>
        The Siboney were the first people to inhabit the islands of Antigua and Barbuda in 2400 B.C., but the Arawaks
        populated the islands when Christopher COLUMBUS landed on his second voyage in 1493. Early Spanish and French
        settlements were succeeded by an English colony in 1667. Slavery, which provided labor on the sugar plantations
        on Antigua, was abolished in 1834. The islands became an independent state within the British Commonwealth of
        Nations in 1981. In 2017, Hurricane Irma passed over the island of Barbuda, devastating the island and forcing
        the evacuation of the population to Antigua. Almost all of the structures on Barbuda were destroyed and the
        vegetation stripped, but Antigua was spared the worst.
