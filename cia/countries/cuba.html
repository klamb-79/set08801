    <h3>
        Background
    </h3>
    <p>
        The native Amerindian population of Cuba began to decline after the arrival of Christopher COLUMBUS in 1492, as
        the country
        was developed as a Spanish colony during the next several centuries. Large numbers of African slaves were
        imported to work the
        coffee and sugar plantations, and Havana became the launching point for the annual treasure fleets bound for
        Spain from Mexico and Peru.
        Spanish rule eventually provoked an independence movement, and occasional rebellions were harshly suppressed. US
        intervention during the
        Spanish-American War in 1898 assisted the Cubans in overthrowing Spanish rule. The Treaty of Paris established
        Cuban independence
        from Spain in 1898, and after three-and-a-half
        years of subsequent US military rule, Cuba became an independent republic in 1902.

        Cuba then experienced a string of governments mostly dominated by the military and corrupt politicians. Fidel
        CASTRO led a rebel
        army to victory in 1959; his authoritarian rule held the subsequent regime together for nearly five decades. He
        handed off the
        presidency to his younger brother Raul CASTRO in 2008. Cuba's communist revolution, with Soviet support, was
        exported throughout
        Latin America and Africa during the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. Miguel DIAZ-CANEL Bermudez, hand-picked by Raul
        CASTRO to succeed him,
        was approved as president by the National Assembly and took office in 2018. DIAZ-CANEL was appointed First
        Secretary of the Communist Party
        in 2021 after the retirement of Raul CASTRO and continues to serve as both president and first secretary.
        Cuba traditionally and consistently portrays the US embargo, in place since 1961, as the source of its
        socioeconomic difficulties.
        As a result of efforts begun in 2014 to reestablish diplomatic relations, the US and Cuba reopened embassies in
        their respective countries in 2015.
        The embargo remains in place, however, and the relationship between the US and Cuba remains tense. Illicit
        migration of Cuban nationals to
        the US via maritime and overland routes has been a longstanding challenge. In 2017, the US and Cuba signed a
        Joint Statement ending the
        so-called "wet-foot, dry-foot" policy, by which Cuban nationals who reached US soil were permitted to stay.
        Irregular Cuban maritime
        migration has dropped significantly since 2016, when migrant interdictions at sea topped 5,000, but land border
        crossings continue.
